@Lunacian

We are releasing a new version of the game today, including improvements to the game’s performance and the return of challenging your friends.

• **Axies will now reset to level one anytime they change owners.** This was the change I mentioned last week that was coming.
• Challenges are back! You can now challenge a trainer on your friends list to a friendly duel.
• Accounts under 800 MMR will no longer receive SLP from adventure, arena, or the daily quest.
• Temporarily, match history will not be saved on our servers and can only be accessed from the client device with which you played the match.
• We have made a small update to the Ronin Block Explorer for how some addresses are displayed.

We are releasing a new version of the game today, including improvements to the game’s performance and the return of challenging your friends.

• Axies will reset to level one anytime they change owners. This change has been live since the first announcement. 
• Challenges are back! You can now challenge a trainer on your friends list to a friendly duel.
• Accounts under 800 MMR will no longer receive SLP from the adventure, arena, or the daily quest. Please see below for more information on this.
• Match history will not be saved on the servers, we will bring this feature back once we have had a chance to optimize it.

**Desktop with Mavis Hub**: Open Mavis Hub and select the update button.
**Android**: See #🌱｜official-links for the Android link.
**iOS**: Please open the Testflight app and refresh the list of apps to see the update. Currently, the beta is full and no one new can join right now. 

**More Information About the 800 MMR Update**

We’ve received a considerable amount of questions, feedback, and concerns regarding our gameplay adjustments in the 1.1.0a release, in particular the 800 MMR restriction.  We thought we’d share some details on what motivated this experiment.  

What are the elements that we believe create a healthy Axie gaming ecosystem?  First and foremost, we believe that our game experiences should be designed so that community members are motivated to build gradual mastery over time.  We also believe that each community member has a role to play in ensuring everyone’s gameplay success (through education, coaching, sharing feedback, etc).  Finally, the game and its underlying economy must be sound.  We strongly believe that any method where the game is manipulated to gain financial benefit without having to build skill threatens the entire ecosystem. 

A review of today’s player data reveals that we have some work to do balancing the gameplay experience. In particular, we have evidence of “bots”, gaming accounts that are scripted to play without a real player, alongside other examples of odd in-game behavior. Today’s MMR restriction was implemented to eliminate poor in-game behavior. __To be clear, our ultimate goal is to reward mastery of the game and everyone’s honest attempts to become a great player__.  As with all experiments, we’ll likely both resolve issues, and perhaps even create new ones.

We believe in you: each and every human in our community has the ability to improve and become proficient in the arena. This change was made with this confidence in mind. That said, we intend to collect considerable data around this tweak: both within the game, and from our community forums (Discord, social media, etc).","","This (1),333_love (1),AxieHard (1),👍 (1),🇵🇭 (1),celebrate (1),BongoAxie (1),Walnut (1),333_laugh (1),Ⓜ️ (1),🇲 (1),🇷 (1),👎 (1),💩 (1),😭 (1),axie_b2Unko (1),AxieLove (1),Sticker_Kotaro (1)"

@Lunacian 

Due to issues that were discovered during the patch, we have made the decision to roll back the game to the previous version. After several hours of intense troubleshooting, we have concluded that this is a performance issue that cannot be fixed in a short period of time. We will make a new announcement before trying again.

This means that it is still version **1.0.0ac** that is live and supported. If you have updated your game today, please follow these steps to revert to the old version:

Android:
1. Delete the newest version
2. Download and install the file from #🌱｜official-links 

iOS:
On testflight , click on 'Previous Builds' > 1.0.0 > Version 1.0.0ac and Install.

1. Close your game AND Mavis Hub.
2. Follow the steps in this guide to delete your old game folder.

@everyone 

In a few moments, several changes will be made to the Discord to ensure our Discord can scale to meet the needs of our growing community. Most channels will require the Lunacian role (those that own three or more Axies) to be able to chat.

• To link your Discord with your Ronin wallet, please visit #🤖｜bot-commands and type !join
• The Collab.Land bot does not need your secret recovery phrase (seed phrase). If any website, person, or bot asks for your secret recovery phrase it is a scam 100%. 
• Channel access will depend on your roles. Many current channels will be inaccessible without the Lunacian role.
• These changes will ensure true Axie Owners represent the community.

Inactive members without the Lunacian role will be the first to be removed and pruned from this server as we make room in the future. This server cannot hold more than 800,000 members and we need to make sure that the majority of these precious slots are held by those that actually own Axies!","","AxieYes (1),🥳 (1),Fire1_White (1),BongoAxie (1),333_love (1),AxieLove (1),partykirby (1),AxieHard (1),party_blob (1),Fire2_Teal (1),partyparrot (1),🍴 (1),AXSgif (1),😩 (1),goodjob (1),⬅️ (1),🤣 (1),Axie1_Puff (1),🇵🇭 (1),👍 (1)"

TLDR, we are:

1. Reimbursing those who lost their funds due to the announcement. No need to report if you lost funds – we are scanning the blockchain directly.
2. Reducing the number of people who can tag everyone on our Discord server.
3. Working with Discord to address security flaws.
4. Reviewing security practices with all team members.

Today, at 03:20 UTC  one of our support-staff had their Discord account compromised as part of an elaborate scam that has impacted several Discord servers (<https://twitter.com/0xInuarashi/status/1454892714789523457>). Below you can find an overview of what occurred and the steps we are taking to fix this situation. 

**How his account was hacked:**

The attacker tricked our support staff to share his screen and  inspect his Network tab (in Chrome). This led to the attacker gaining access to the support staffer’s Discord account, **despite 2-factor authentication being enabled.**

The attacker then created a fake Axe Infinity branded webpage, and used a Discord bot to spam the link on all of Axie Infinity’s Discord announcement channels announcing an exclusive sale. 155 players clicked on the link and attempted to buy Axies, which was a scam.

Those who interacted with the smart contract lost the money they sent. We have reviewed the smart contract and concluded that it does **not** impact their seed phrases. Nonetheless, we recommend that everyone who interacted with the smart contract go to: <https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker> and revoke access to this site immediately. 

**Next steps**

We take security issues extremely seriously and are committing to:

1. Reimbursing those who lost their funds due to the announcement. No need to report if you lost funds – we are scanning the blockchain directly.
2. Reducing the number of people who can tag everyone on our Discord server.
3. Working with Discord to address security flaws.
4. Reviewing security practices with all team members.

@everyone @Lunacian 

- PVP season 19 is live with 3,000 AXS in rewards (currently valued at $400,000+) and the season will last for 6 weeks.
- We’ve launched a major rebalancing patch based on data collected over the past months.
- MMR has been reset to seasonal: everyone begins with 1,200
- We’ve adjusted the formulas for both bonus damage on critical strikes as well as the skill stats effect on bonus damage for combos.

**Players do not need to update their game, this patch is server-side only.**

@Lunacian @everyone 

**Key Points**
• 18,505 Axies were banned as a result of multiple account abuse.
• We modified the ban terms over the weekend upon discovering an error in our detection algorithms.
• We've updated the TOS to make the rules around multi-accounting more clear.

Over the weekend, we banned 18,505 Axies that were involved in systematic abuse of the multiple accounts rule. This involved situations where one human was playing and earning in-game resources on multiple Axie game accounts over a 24 hour period. This type of abuse is harmful to the economy and community-- we collectively must work to hold each other accountable to our rules.

For example, scholarship leaders should actively work to ensure that scholars are not misrepresenting themselves and that each scholar only has access to one account. Some actions that can be taken to prevent this include scholarship applications that quiz applicants on the Axie terms of service, and video interviews.

Upon re-examination of the data this weekend, **we discovered a error in our detection algorithms causing some innocent Axies to get banned.** These Axies alongside other Axies that were sold on the marketplace prior to this detection wave have all been unbanned.

We also recognize that some of the banned Axies belong to well meaning-managers who are still learning how to best screen scholars. **The bans in this wave have been reduced to 90 days** which we believe gives managers a strong incentive to ensure that scholars are only playing on one in-game account. 

Our Terms of Service  have been updated to make these rules clearer <https://axieinfinity.com/terms/>.  Please consider these Terms of Service carefully, as future ban waves will be less forgiving.

We know this affects a lot of you, and appreciate your continued support.  Let’s work together as a community to ensure a fair gaming environment for all players and promote continuous healthy growth.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414758518101639188/912379798465167381/Announcement_Banner_13.png","👀 (1),🇵🇭 (1),🇻🇪 (1),🇦🇷 (1),SmallLovePotion (1),❤️‍🩹 (1),BongoAxie (1),🇲🇽 (1),Axie_5sunglass (1),This (1),PetTheAxie (1),HaroldCringe (1),🤦‍♂️ (1),🇵🇪 (1),🇨🇴 (1),😩 (1),😂 (1),🇧🇷 (1),🇻🇳 (1),🇷 (1)"

@Lunacian @here

Hey Trainers, we have some very exciting news! In the upcoming days, the ten millionth Axie will be born. We want to celebrate with a Breeding event. The trainer who breeds the ten millionth Axie will win a Tanuki Mystic land item. Per our TOS, no automation will be allowed. Any violation of the TOS will result in all Axies in the offending account and connected accounts being banned and the trainer being disqualified from the event. Please review our TOS at https://axieinfinity.com/terms prior to the Breeding event. Below is also a snippet of the TOS which refers to the rules for a breeding event.

Breeding, EXCEPT when there is a breeding event happening. Axie Infinity will announce these events at least 1 week in advance on Discord and Twitter. Interacting with the breeding smart contracts directly during breeding events is expressly prohibited.

To be clear, this one week advance notice is a warning that you should disable your automated breeding before Axie 10M is born. If you cannot monitor your automation until Axie 10M is born you should disable it now.

A large portion of our community is new to crypto and only a very tiny fraction of you were with us during the hard times of the Bear market of 2018 & 2019. Education is more important than ever!

We’re excited to announce the launch of our first Axie community-run Ronin validator node by AxieChat!

Read their full announcement here: https://axiechat.medium.com/axiechat-community-node-4197d8bb4753

This is the first step in ensuring that Ronin is owned, operated, and validated by the community that loves it.

Recently, the AxieChat team submitted an impressively comprehensive proposal to the existing validators to host a community-sponsored node.  It's becoming clear that in groups like AxieChat, and others, that our community has reached a stage of maturity where we can continue this process of empowering the community to provide and maintain core infrastructure for our ecosystem.

We anticipate further demand from our community to help validate Ronin. Today signifies a step closer to a more open and community-led future for the network. We’re working on building out a structured process for reviewing and on-boarding more validators from the community. This will be a multi-step process and we're beyond excited to travel this road with you!","","LeekSpin (1),BongoAxie2 (1),Axie_Eye_Skyleft (1),🇦🇷 (1),333_thug (1),SmallLovePotion (1),🇹 (1),🇮 (1),🇷 (1),🇰 (1),💯 (1),Ronin (1),4️⃣ (1),🍇 (1),AxieInfinityShard (1),3️⃣ (1),BloomingLeek (1),HaroldCringe (1),💩 (1)"

**Extending This Season 2 Weeks**

Recently we have received reports of cheating in the arenas, and after a detailed investigation, we have confirmed these reports to be true. We have since identified the source of the cheat and resolved the issue.

The cheat allowed players to see what cards their opponent had played after pressing end turn. This gave cheaters a clear advantage over any player that did not run out the clock on each turn.

We do not believe this cheat was widely used, but have taken action to preserve the integrity of game. 

Because we are so close to the end of the season, we have decided to extend the season by two weeks. Season 19 will now end on January 4th, 2022. This extension allows trainers adequate time to achieve their correct rank.

Thanks for understanding, and good luck with your push for the extended season!","","👀 (1),😮‍💨 (1),👌 (1),🍇 (1),333_love (1),This (1),🤣 (1),SmallLovePotion (1),333_giggle (1),333_thug (1),420_musk (1),Axie_a2Reptile (1),Fire1_White (1),BongoAxie2 (1),Fire3_Blue (1),333_laugh (1),👍 (1),Fire5_Orange (1),Axie_6kiss (1),HaroldCringe (1)"

Thanks to numerous reports from the community and published video examples, we have learned about a growing problem with “win-trading” inside the community. One event, in particular was carried out in public and a clear example of abuse. We've decided to take action against the parties involved. It's important for Axie to remain an honorable place for us all to battle, build, and compete together.

There will be an update to the Terms of Service that clearly expresses zero tolerance for collusion and match-fixing.

We will continue to highly prioritize the development of rules, incentives, and consequences that protect the competitive integrity of our games.

We realize the recent off-season mmr reset came as a bit of a surprise, especially given that I clarified how off-seasons work back in September.

Off-season was originally intended to have zero rewards and give us time to update the game. But we decided to keep SLP in there to give players something to compete for.

Over time we observed that the off-season mmr went too high and too much SLP was produced. 

So today we have made an update to how the off-seasonal mmr system works. All players will now be reset to 1200 mmr in each off-season.

We believe this, and other future changes will help stabilize the SLP economy.

**__Axie Infinity Code Of Conduct__**

Hi!  My name is Paul, and recently I joined Axie Infinity as the Community Lead. My focus within the community is to find ways to engage, empower, and to help organize everyone to continue to build out our digital nation.  We are committed to opening stronger lines of communication within our community on all fronts… thanks in advance for your patience as we try to scale quickly! Over the next couple of months, expect to see progress on various conventions we’ll establish together. That starts today with the release of the Axie Infinity Code of Conduct (http://axieinfinity.com/code-of-conduct)  :BongoAxie2:

We are a community that prides itself on it's strong values. Our ambitions are lofty, and we believe that together we can accomplish anything if we respect and honor all members of our community.  As such, it’s important to ensure this future by coming to a clear consensus on how we should all interact with each other.

Therefore, over the last couple of months, members of our community have developed the Axie Infinity Code of Conduct. The Code is the foundation of our community culture. It sets expectations for how we all treat each other. We hope and expect that everyone will follow these standards.  Together, we should work to hold each other accountable to the Code, and ensure the community remains incredibly welcoming to all.

This Code is a community experiment. Each community has a personality of it’s own, and we are interested in learning from you all on the best way to hold each other accountable to these standards.  Your input will help us determine the best way to do this. Let’s work through this together.

This document is also a living, breathing, continually evolving document. If you have any additional suggestions or comments, let us know by using the hashtag #AxieCodeofConduct.

We also wanted to share an awesome graphic version of the Code created by @blaumitz , one of our very talented community members.  Please feel free to share it widely on social media!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414758518101639188/930533065518874624/The_Axie_Infinity_Code_of_Conduct.jpg","🚀 (1),🫂 (1),Fire5_Orange (1),333_giggle (1),👏 (1),🧀 (1),🔒 (1),📰 (1),🤜 (1),SLPbounce (1),FlappyAxie (1),FlappyKotaro (1),AxieYes (1),Fire1_White (1),🤍 (1)"

__**Balancing Buffer Period**__    

We've just deployed a pre-season 20 Balancing patch!

We’ve released this patch prior to the release of the season to ensure sufficient time for play-testing. This should catch any unintended mechanics and consequences of the patch. This means that until Season 20 is formally launched, we may launch hot-fixes.

This is a day we’ve been looking forward to since 2018. Axie releasing, an important component to Axies’ lives and a key lever in our quest for economic balance, is finally here! We know that this is a feature that the community has been patiently waiting for, and we couldn’t be more excited to show it off to the world! 

Lunacians now have the opportunity to release their Axies to live independently in Lunacia, and in return their Axies will send them back some exclusive gifts. These will be Lunar New Year exclusive Land items!

__**Preseason Balancing Update #2**__

We have just deployed some balance changes after collecting feedback from our changes last week.

We anticipate that this will be the last balancing until the Season 21 buffer period. However, we may make hotfixes until the launch of Season 20 if there are unforeseen issues in the meta.

A quick reminder that once season 20 starts, we do not intend to make any card balance changes. There may be extraordinary cases where a mechanic slips through, but in those cases, we will signal through our communication channels in advance and ask for community input before deploying a balance change.

A note from the balancing team on Dawn base stat changes:
Right now Dawn are unplayable due to their stat allocation. They're slower than bird, aqua, mech, dusk and getting outshined. Taking away 4 morale (which is not useful in small quantities) and allocating it to speed will put them on more of a level playing field. They will be similar to mech in that they will be fast and do consistent damage with skill but with different optimal cards due to body type.

Additional Improvements:
- We modified the visual effects to be more in sync with the Axie's actions.
- Fixed a bug that displayed the incorrect class icon.
- Axie expressions are back!
- Updated some actions to display the correct trigger text.

**To update to the latest version, please see the instructions for your specific platform below:**
Desktop with Mavis Hub: Open Mavis Hub and select the update button.
Android: See #🌱｜official-links 
iOS: Please open the TestFlight app and refresh the list of apps to see the update. The current version will still work but an update is coming. (depending on the Apple review process it make take 24-48 hours for the update to show)

edit 1: Added the word card before balance. This is to show we may make changes to other areas of the game but the cards will remain the same.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414758518101639188/935451273870860338/unknown.png,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414758518101639188/935451274122522694/unknown.png","💟 (4875),333_love (748),AxieYes (589),celebrate (496),BongoAxie2 (392),333_giggle (308),This (323),AxieLove (298),❤️ (442),333_thug (282),Fire5_Orange (393),👍 (739)"

__**Upcoming Season 20 & Economic Balancing Adjustments**__

Season 20 is close and when it’s released, a variety of  important economic balancing changes will be implemented.

We believe that these economic changes will allow us to start righting the ship and getting the economy moving in the right direction. We know that it will be key to execute on delivering new burn mechanisms this year. These issuance reductions will not be enough to get our economic engine back to full strength, but they are a needed step as we build towards a fully-functioning and sustainable economy.

"143127754760650752","Psycheout | Axie Infinity Core#0001","09-Feb-22 05:08 PM","Hi @everyone @Lunacian 

I'm happy to announce that Season 20 in the PvP Arena is live.

**Key Points**
- MMR has been reset, everyone starts at 1200
- PVP season 20 is live with over $7M USD in AXS rewards!
- Daily quest SLP has been removed.
- Adventure mode SLP has been removed.
- SLP rewards have been reduced at certain MMR brackets.
- Trainers under 800 MMR will now receive 1 SLP per win.
- Improvements and bug fixes:
    -> Bulkwark/Tiny Catapult and Carrot/Snail shell interaction interaction now works as intended.
    -> Bulkwark/Tiny Catapult and Sponge/Bone Sail interaction interaction now works as intended.
    -> Players could occasionally hold more than 12 cards on hand, this is now impossible.

**Elimination of Adventure Mode and Daily Quest Rewards**
As a first measure to stabilize the economy, we have removed all SLP rewards from adventure mode (this includes the SLP rewards for first-time completion.)

Adventure mode was originally conceived as a way for the community to learn how to use their Axies. It has outlived its purpose as a way for people to earn tokens from the game.

**Next, we have removed the 25 SLP reward from the daily quest.**
The daily quest, in principle, was great to encourage people to play everyday but it’s now become a mass emission mechanism for SLP. By removing the daily quest we are able to reduce issuance by around 45 million SLP per day. We love the idea of quests and hope to re-introduce a quest mechanism in the future through Origin, but this will need to come in tandem with new burn mechanisms from new features.

**New AXS Leaderboard Rewards**
For Season 20, we’ve expanded the number of leaderboard slots to 300,000 and increased the amount of AXS we’re giving out to 117,676. 

This will supercharge the competitive Axie scene and create more demand for quality Axie teams in the ecosystem.  This equates to a seven million USD equivalent prize pool for Season 20! This is one of the largest prize pools a game has ever seen and most importantly, it’s being rolled out to millions of gamers all over the world on equal terms. This would not have been possible without Ronin and smart contract-based technology.

We’ve also revised the amount of SLP per win at various MMR brackets. We’ve brought back 1 SLP per win for players under 800 MMR. This will bring some utility to weaker Axies and encourage players to practice even if they’re still learning or having difficulty with the game. Advancements with our bot detection system as well as reduced earnings for bots have also made reintroduction of these rewards possible.

This season lasts for **6 weeks!**
February 9, 2022 10:00 AM To March 22, 2022 10:00 AM CET.

**Here are the new MMR brackets and SLP rewards:**
0-999 – 0 --> 1 SLP per win
1000-1099 – 3 SLP per win
1100-1299 – 6 --> 5 SLP per win (Rank default)
1300-1499 – 9 --> 6 SLP per win
1500-1799 – 12 --> 8 SLP per win
1800-1999 – 15 --> 10 SLP per win
2000 - 2499 - 18 --> 12 SLP per win
2500+ - 14 SLP per win

**Linear Energy Gain For Axies?**
As we mentioned in our previous update, we are considering making energy scale more linearly for Axies held on an account. We will look at new data generated by Season 20 to help us further explore this idea.

Substack article will be available a bit later today.

You’ll notice that many of the cards are reminiscent of their current versions with a fresh twist for Origin! Please note that cards are dynamic and will change over time based on feedback from the community and data we collect around relative power.

All of the Mystic parts will of course still be clearly visible. The visual update will have a unique lore connection that will be unveiled over time as well!

**__New Account Service__**

In preparation for Origin, we are launching a new account service. Many of the changes are behind the scenes and will not be seen. During the maintenance window, you will be unable to log in to any Axie service. Once the maintenance is complete, all current logins to the marketplace and game will be invalid. You will need a new QR code to log in to the game. Due to substantial anticipated demand for logins, the service may be slow, and you may need to try a few times or wait a few hours and then try again.

• Your marketplace email cannot be changed until a future release. We do not have an ETA at this time.
• The new account service management site is: https://accounts.skymavis.com (will not be available until after the maintenance)
• All logins will be invalidated and you will need to login again. 

The new account service will also allow you to sign in with your Google or Facebook (or Meta?) account. 

Maintenance will begin at: 08-Mar-22 04:00 PM (This is in your timezone)","","🔥 (1),🐰 (1),🇵🇭 (1),💟 (1)"

**__In Game Bug and Axie Abuse__**

We have confirmed reports of an in-game issue. This bug causes some Axies to fail when loading into an Arena match. This bug is being abused in a specific way that allows cheaters to win the game.
This type of abuse is distinct, and we can detect it. Those abusing the bug violate our Terms of Service, and we will review each case.

If you are not using this specific abuse, you do not have to worry about your Axies being banned. If you are not sure, then this does not apply to you. 

**In about 24 hours, we will deploy an update to prevent the abuse of this bug by blocking all bugged Axies from queueing up for the arena.** We will resolve the issue during our next client release, and these Axies will be allowed to battle in the arena again. You will know if you have one of these Axies because the home screen will display the loading icon and never load the image of the Axie. Also, if you attempt to queue with a bugged Axie, you will see an error message.","","💟 (1),🔥 (1),AxieYes (1),🤣 (1),👍 (1),👀 (1),AxieLove (1),150831 (1)"

In addition to resetting the MMR of these accounts, we have taken the following actions:
   - Banned all Axies in the account for seven days. This corresponds to a little after the end of season 20. 
   - Banned the Axie team used during the abuse for 365 days.
   - Each account forfeits any season 20 rewards they would have earned.

This action comes now because we needed additional time to determine the Axie team used during the abuse. We are serious about competitive integrity, and we believe the actions above reflect that.","","💯 (1),👍 (1),✅ (1),This (1),😱 (1),🎉 (1),333_thug (1),🙌 (1),AxieLove (1),axie_potato (1)"

__**Axie Infinity: Origin Soft Launch**__

All hands are on deck internally around the soft launch of Axie Infinity: Origin.
We want to provide some updates around what our community should expect 👇 

The launch of Origin will come in phases. We will start with a small scope and gradually expand in the months after initial launch.

First, Origin will be launched on desktop devices through the Mavis Hub. This period will center around gathering vital feedback, testing scalability of our servers, and enabling our community to start adjusting to the new game mechanics.

Next, roughly a month after the release of Origin through desktop, we will  launch Origin for Android through a mobile APK. We’ve decided to launch mobile separately to ensure our servers have enough capacity to support millions of players.

Once the mobile and desktop versions are live, we will work towards doing a full launch that also incorporates SLP rewards, NFT Charms / Runes, and have official Seasons. In parallel, we will also be actively working towards making necessary tweaks to the game so that it can be approved and listed in the Android and iOS app stores.

Origin will soft-launch with a limited set of features including PVE story mode, Runes, Charms, training mode, and a ranked mode. Over time, we will iterate and update it to include features such as cosmetics, upgraded parts, tournaments, PVP seasons, and a rogue-like game mode. 

Axie Infinity is a community-driven ecosystem. Your feedback will be key to ensuring that we upgrade and improve Origin in a thoughtful and data-driven manner. We couldn’t be more excited to share Origin with all of you. Thank you for the patience as we all eagerly anticipate the next phase of our collective journey.

⚔️ __**Origin Ear Cards**__ 🛡️

Axie Infinity: Origin is fast approaching! 

While we continue building towards our initial soft launch through the Mavis Hub, we have our next set of Origin cards for you to check out-- the ears! This is the first time in Axie’s history that ears will have their own of cards!

Again, please note that cards are dynamic and will change over time based on feedback from the community and data we collect around relative power. Do not make market decisions based on these teasers, they are meant to serve as a taste of what’s to come in Origin and allow you all to start theory-crafting.

Here are Origin's ear cards 👇

__**The Community Treasury & Progressive Decentralization**__

Axie is owned by its players— but what does this mean?

To make this clear, here are our thoughts on progressive decentralization, the Axie Community Treasury, and an updated roadmap for community governance.

__**Increasing Utility for RON**__

We will be reducing the free transactions each account receives on 29-Mar-22 03:00 PM (in your local time). The free transactions ensured a smooth introduction of the RON token; however, the free gas RPC (the system that allows for free transactions) has limited space. As our ecosystem grows, we will need to reduce our reliance on it. Over time, more transactions will require RON to ensure that the free gas RPC is not overwhelmed and RON has sufficient utility on the Ronin Network.

Here are the changes for the new free transaction system. Below it shows the current amount and then what the updated amounts will be:
:Ronin: Free transactions for owning Axies:
        1 normal Axie: 3 txs/day ⟹ 1 or more normal Axies: 0 txs/month
        1 MEO Axie: 10 txs/day ⟹ 1 or more MEO Axies: 2 txs/month
        1 Origin Axie: 100 txs/day ⟹ 1 or more Origin Axies: 10 txs/month
        1 Mystic Axie: 500 txs/day ⟹ 1 or more Mystic Axies: 80 txs/month
:Ronin: Free transactions for owning Land:
        1 Savannah Land: 20 txs/day ⟹ 1 or more Savannah Land: 8 txs/month
        1 Forest Land: 60 txs/day ⟹ 1 or more Forest Lands: 26 txs/month
        1 Arctic Land: 180 txs/day ⟹ 1 or more Arctic Lands: 72 txs/month
        1 Mystic Land: 350 txs/day ⟹ 1 or more Mystic Lands: 160 txs/month

**Free Transaction Calculation Mechanism**
    :Ronin: Each account will receive a certain number of free transactions per month based on the highest value NFT it has. For example, if an account has 1 Arctic land and 1 Mystic land it gets 160 tx/month rather than 72 + 160 tx/month.
        
    :Ronin: Your total free transactions are based on an average of the Axie assets you owned and the amount of days you owned them in the month. For example, if you only owned a Mystic Axie for one day in a 30 day month then the formula is (1 Mystic Axie * 1 day) / 30 = 0 (decimal is not considered). You would not have any free transactions for the month. In order to receive the free transactions your wallet would need to hold the Mystic Axie for the entire month.

If you run out of free transactions, you will need to create a new account, purchase RON on Katana, and send some of that RON to the original account. Some regions of the world can purchase RON through the Ronin wallet using their credit card.","","👍 (1),Fire6_Orange (1),BlobWave (1),AxieYes (1),celebrate (1),333_love (1),🤣 (1),AxieWave (1),💯 (1),ronin (1)"

Just how close to Origin are we?

While we let that simmer and marinate, we have our final set of Origin cards— the eyes! This is the first time in Axie’s 4 year history that eyes will have their own cards!

__**Protecting Competitive Integrity In Axie**__

During a multi-day investigation, the Community Protection team reviewed 3000 replays from highly ranked players and unveiled irrefutable evidence that match-fixing had occurred. This is strictly prohibited by Section 4 of our Terms of Service. When these players match against each other, they would purposely end the battle in a tie, resulting in a slight loss of MMR for each player.

As a result, we are taking the following actions against seven accounts and 210 Axies in those accounts.

**Ban List**
The list of players currently banned from Axie eSports can be found in the Google Sheet below:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J5rUd5YrXMw92691wnUCxG8q2FtO5bPmZHjS2FFlj5A/edit?usp=sharing

**Disciplinary Actions**
The banned accounts forfeit season 20 AXS rewards.
All Axies in the accounts have been banned for 999 days.
Each player is Indefinitely banned from participating in Axie eSports tournaments.

**Disciplinary Action Justification**
We ban Axies and remove AXS rewards for accounts that violate our Terms to discourage anyone from participating in these activities. Our goal is to make the penalties of cheating outweigh the benefits. Similarly, we made a detailed post on January 1, 2022 issuing a final warning to all players regarding zero tolerance for any kind of match-fixing or collusion.

The industry standard in eSports is to issue indefinite bans for players cheating at the highest ranks. We believe this lengthy ban of 999 days represents how seriously we take competitive integrity.","","🐰 (1),👍 (1),✅ (1),❤️ (1),😍 (1),AxieYes (1),AxieLove (1),AxieInfinityShard (1),🇵🇭 (1),Prism (1),🧁 (1),ban2 (1)"

__**Community Alert: Ronin Validators Compromised**__

There has been a security breach on the Ronin Network. On March 23rd, Sky Mavis’s Ronin validator nodes and Axie DAO validator nodes were compromised resulting in 173,600 Ethereum and 25.5M USDC being drained from the Ronin bridge in two transactions (1 and 2). The attacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals. We discovered the attack this morning after a report from a user being unable to withdraw 5k ETH from the bridge. 

Sky Mavis is here for the long term and will continue to build. 

**Key Points**
• The Ronin bridge has been exploited for 173,600 Ethereum and 25.5M USDC.
• The Ronin bridge and Katana Dex have been halted until we are sure that the network is safe to resume activity.
• We are working with law enforcement officials, forensic cryptographers, and our investors to make sure all funds are recovered or reimbursed. All of the AXS, RON, and SLP on Ronin are safe right now.

Welcome to Origin Launch Week! We have a full schedule of leeks & events planned over the next seven days, culminating with the launch of Axie Infinity: Origin on April 7th!

We had originally planned to launch Origin today. After the security breach, we needed to reprioritize some team members, and shift the launch date by one week. 

We are incredibly excited to get Origin into the hands of our community! We are going to keep building and moving forward together. Thanks for all your support this week, we need you now more than ever before.

As a reminder, Runes & Charms are power-ups that add all new customization and theory crafting to Origin’s already robust meta! 

**Runes** are special power-ups that can be equipped to your axie. Each axie can equip one rune. **Charms** are power-ups that enhance an axie's parts and abilities. Each of an axie's six abilities can equip one charm.

We are pleased to reveal that we have raised a $150 million USD funding round led by the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, with participation from Animoca Brands, a16z, Dialectic, Paradigm and Accel. The round will be used to reimburse user funds affected by the Ronin Validator Hack. 

While racing for mainstream adoption, we made some trade-offs that ended up leaving us vulnerable to this sort of attack. It’s a lesson that we’ve learned the hard way. A lesson that will guide how we build Ronin out moving forward. We’re confident that we will come out stronger and wiser from this.

We will continue building together with this community. This is a journey that will be measured in decades. Onward!

__**Land Development Update Feedback**__

Thanks to everyone that tuned into our land development stream today.

We’ve received and reviewed tons of early feedback on the presentation. Your voices have been heard.

One of the major points we’ve seen is around the opportunity cost of holding land relative to other productive assets in our ecosystem. Initially, we planned on saving AXS rewards for land until the game was released, and using that AXS as fuel to drive engagement.

**Given the pivots/changes in direction and community feedback, we’ve decided to revisit a light-weight approach to land utility and earning potential prior to release. This will likely combine some sort of land staking with gameplay requirements.**

Today serves as a reminder that your voices are powerful and that we are listening. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, onward!

__**Season 21 Launching on April 25th**__

After consideration, we’ve decided to move forward with S21 for Axie Infinity: Classic (V2) on April 25th as planned. There will be no balancing changes.

Here’s why:

• We previously committed to having S21 and know that many of you were planning on one last chance to take home the Season crown in classic.

• Logistically speaking, running S21 will not divert significant resources from Origin, especially as we will not be doing a card balancing patch.

• We’re confident that you will continue to test and give awesome feedback on Origin and that S21 won’t distract greatly from this process. 

The current plan is to continue testing and upgrading Origin while also having S21 run from April 25th to June 24th. After S21 is completed, we should be much closer to having the competitive pillars in place to embark on Origin’s first leaderboard season with a tokenized prize pool. At that time, we will also consider moving SLP rewards from Classic to Origin.
